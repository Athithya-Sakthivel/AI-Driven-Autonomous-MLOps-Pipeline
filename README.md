### **Blueprint for AI-Driven Autonomous MLOps Pipeline Capstone**

#### **1. Problem Statement:**
**Title:**  
**"Real-Time Drift Detection and Model Optimization using AI Agents in an End-to-End Autonomous MLOps Pipeline"**

In AI-driven applications, models degrade in performance over time due to changing data distributions (data drift) or model drift. Traditional MLOps pipelines address model retraining in a static manner but often fail to react to real-time shifts in data, leading to suboptimal performance or decision-making. This project aims to design and implement an **AI-augmented autonomous pipeline** capable of **real-time drift detection, automated retraining, and dynamic optimization** of machine learning models using **AI agents**, focusing on drift handling with **Evidently AI** and optimization using **Optuna**.

The project will integrate an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** that:
- **Monitors data drift** in real-time using advanced data sources.
- **Detects model drift** and triggers automated actions.
- **Retrains models dynamically** based on drift detection and performance degradation.
- **Optimizes models autonomously** using AI agents, improving hyperparameter tuning and inference efficiency.
- **Uses synthetic data generation** to simulate edge cases and drift scenarios for more robust models.

The pipeline will be implemented both **locally** and deployed to **AWS** for scaling and production-level deployment.

#### **2. Data Source(s):**
**Primary Dataset: GDELT Global Database**  
The **GDELT Project** monitors the world’s broadcast, print, and online news in real-time, translating it into a comprehensive open database of global human societal activity. It’s ideal for your use case because:
- **Multimodal**: Includes topics like **events, sentiment**, and **metadata**.
- **Real-time updates**: Constantly evolving data can serve as a real-world source for **data drift detection**.
- **Advanced time-series data**: Provides a rich ground to detect shifts in societal trends, sentiment, and event frequency, which can cause data drift and serve as a good test case for your pipeline.

**Advanced Dataset 2 (Optional for Simulations): Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection Data**  
This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced (positive class: fraud accounts for 0.172% of all transactions), making it perfect to test for model drift in fraud detection models due to its evolving patterns in fraudulent transactions. You can **simulate model drift** by incrementally adding transactions over time.

**Synthetic Data Generation**  
- **CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN)**: CTGAN will be used to generate synthetic data that mimics real-world drift scenarios. For example, you can simulate sudden shifts in patterns like fraud detection or sudden event surges in the GDELT dataset, testing how robust your models and drift detection system are.

#### **3. Objectives of the Project**:
1. **Real-Time Data Drift Detection**: Use **Evidently AI** to continuously monitor both data and model drift, allowing the pipeline to trigger automated responses.
2. **AI-Augmented Pipeline with Autonomous Agents**: Deploy AI agents that can:
   - Ingest data and detect anomalies in ingestion.
   - Monitor model drift and trigger retraining automatically.
   - Tune hyperparameters autonomously using **Optuna**.
3. **Dynamic Model Retraining and Optimization**: When drift is detected, AI agents will handle:
   - Model retraining based on new incoming data.
   - Real-time hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance post-retraining.
4. **Scalable Deployment**: Design the pipeline to run **locally** during development and be deployed to **AWS** for scaling, leveraging tools like **Pulumi** for infrastructure management and **Docker** for containerization.
